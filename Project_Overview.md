## RemindGo Pro — Concept Brief

### Problem Every day, thousands of drivers enter congestion, ULEZ, and toll zones without
realising it or forget to pay later. This leads to millions of pounds in fines each year, wasted time,
and frustration. Existing apps (e.g. RingGo, TfL Pay, PayByPhone) only handle their own limited
zones, rely on manual input, and often drain battery through constant location tracking.

### Solution RemindGo Pro is a low-battery, low-data, automatic reminder app that detects when
you’ve entered a chargeable driving zone and notifies you instantly — before you get fined.
- Uses local geofencing via official GeoJSON polygon data (e.g. TfL Congestion & ULEZ zones) 
- Employs low-power location APIs and significant-movement triggers (no always-on GPS) 
- Sendscontextual smart reminders (“You’ve entered the London ULEZ – pay by midnight”) 
- Privacy-first:all detection runs on-device, no cloud tracking - Scales easily to UK cities, toll bridges, and 
European low-emission zones

### Target Users Urban drivers & commuters, delivery & gig drivers, fleet managers, and travellers
in EU cities — all seeking to avoid fines and manage charge zones effortlessly.

### Revenue Model 
1. Freemium App – free for London; premium plan (£1.99–£3.99 / mo) for UK
& EU coverage. 
2. Quick-Pay Integration – link to TfL/DartCharge payment portals; potential micro-commissions. 
3. Fleet Tier – multi-driver monitoring, expense reports, and automated payment exports. 
4. Data/API Layer (Phase 2) – license geo-zone datasets to mapping and navigation partners.

### Competitive Edge 
- Multi-city coverage 
- Automatic entry alerts 
- Low-battery & offline mode 
-Privacy-first (no tracking)

### Tech Stack Android: Kotlin + Fused Location API + Geofencing Client + local GeoJSON parser
iOS: Swift + Core Location Region Monitoring Backend: Firebase / Supabase for updates, analytics,
and zone metadata Data: Public GIS (TfL, OpenStreetMap, EU Urban Access Regulations
Database)

### Next Steps 
1. Prototype a single-city (London) MVP with one GeoJSON zone and notificationtest. 
2. Refine battery optimisation (significant location change, 15-minute polling fallback). 
3. AddULEZ + Dartford zones, build a simple payment reminder UI. 
4. Pilot release with local drivers →  gather retention & engagement metrics. 
5. Expand dataset to other UK & EU cities. 6. Launch premium tier + fleet version.

### Tagline “Never get fined again. Smart, private, automatic reminders for every pay-to-drive
zone.”
